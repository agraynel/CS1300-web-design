    <h3>OUR EVENTS</h3>
    <a>Education Seminars</a>
    <p>SBA provides an educative training series to its members by hosting bi-monthly discussions and monthly seminars.
    These lectures begin with the basic elements of business, then develop into the purpose and practical applications of
    corporate sustainability. Our training series is an effective way to encourage competence and financial literacy in the
    fields of sustainable business without the pressure entailed by a typical, graded course.

    <a>Guest Lectures</a>
    <p>SBA values the experience of todayâ€™s industry leaders.
    We invite representatives from companies such as BlackRock, Credit Suisse, and AT&T,
    as often as possible, to dig deeper into the content covered in our training series.
    Guest speakers give students a more dimensional perspective on sustainable business and its functions today.

    <a>Private Networking</a>
    <p>A primary goal of SBA is to provide the means for our members to engage with industry leaders,
     powerful alumni, influential faculty, and other club members in the context of entering the industry.
    We achieve this through private networking events where members not only build connections, but practice and
     develop the networking skills necessary to succeed in business.
